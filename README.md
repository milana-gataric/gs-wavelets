This is a Matlab implementation of generalized sampling for the reconstruction of wavelet coefficients from Fourier measurements by Clarice Poon and Milana Gataric.

If you use this code, please cite the original paper where it was introduced: [M. Gataric and C. Poon, A practical guide to the recovery of wavelet coefficients from Fourier measurements](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/15M1018630).

Some variables can be precomputed and are available

To get started, please see readme.pdf, _contents_.txt and Examples.
