This is a Matlab implementation of generalized sampling for the reconstruction of wavelet coefficients from Fourier measurements by Clarice Poon and Milana Gataric.

A detailed description of the implementation can be found in [M. Gataric and C. Poon, A practical guide to the recovery of wavelet coefficients from Fourier measurements](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/15M1018630).

Some variables can be precomputed and are available
[here](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/afha/code/precomputed_files.zip).
